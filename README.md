# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a list of biodata of 150 company employees.

**Column descriptions:**
- Age: Age in years
- Gender: Gender
- Height (cm): Body Height in centimeters
- Weight (kg): Body Weight in kilogram
- Index: Grouping based on Body Mass Index

# Project Summary

## Background

You are a data scientist in a diet meal and healty catering service company. Your Planning Team has comissioned you to examine the base metabolic rate (BMR) from the customer. This information will next be used for consideration in diet menu arrangement.

## Objectives

a. Create two explicit functions both takes male and female BMR calculation for then to be used in computation.

b. Create new column named BMR comprised of results of the base metabolic rate (BMR) calculation respective  each customer's gender. 

c. Calculate the average body weight for male gender with age more than equal to 24 years to less than equal to 35.

## Methods

- The problems are solved by using Numpy and Pandas library on a Python Notebook file

## Results

- The explicit functions have been successfully created using Numpy calculations. They are ready to use in BMR calculation 

- The functions have been put to test to calculate the data of 150 employees. The result is attached to the original data

- Successfully calculated the requested information using Pandas queries.
